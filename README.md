## Java QAP2 - Assorted Programs

Several programs required for Winter 2025 Java QAP2. Includes:

- MyLine (and MyPoint)
- MyRectangle
- Credit Card

## NOTE
I'm experimenting with Intellij's git-based features, so some local branches won't be on here. Possibly making errors in commit hygene as a result of different software.

1. 9-10 hours.

3. I did not need to ask any clasmates.
4. I did not need to ask any instructors.
5. 2/10 overall. The QAP was not difficult, simply taking a while to complete. A similar problem should be no trouble to complete in the future.
